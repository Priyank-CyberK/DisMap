# DisMap: Advanced Network Vulnerability Scanner üåêüîç

## Overview

DisMap is an advanced network scanning and vulnerability detection tool that provides comprehensive security insights by leveraging authoritative vulnerability databases and intelligent scanning techniques.

## Key Features üöÄ

- **Comprehensive Vulnerability Intelligence**
  - Real-time vulnerability data integration
  - Cross-referenced vulnerability information
  - Multi-source vulnerability mapping

- **Advanced Scanning Capabilities**
  - Multi-protocol TCP scanning
  - Configurable scan strategies
  - Adaptive timing templates
  - Detailed service and version detection

- **Intelligent Vulnerability Management**
  - NVD (National Vulnerability Database) integration
  - MITRE CVE cross-referencing
  - Automated vulnerability correlation
  - Comprehensive reporting mechanisms

## Vulnerability Data Sources üìä

DisMap aggregates vulnerability information from multiple authoritative sources:

- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**
  - Maintained by NIST
  - Provides standardized vulnerability information
  - Includes CVSS scoring and detailed vulnerability descriptions

- **MITRE CVE List**
  - Comprehensive Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) repository
  - Globally recognized vulnerability identification system
  - Provides unique identifiers for known cybersecurity vulnerabilities

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage üìã

### Basic Scanning
```bash
# Quick network scan
python dismap.py 192.168.1.1

# Full comprehensive scan
python dismap.py 192.168.1.1 -t full -T4

# Targeted port scanning
python dismap.py 192.168.1.1 -p 22,80,443
```

### Scan Configurations

#### Scan Types
- `-t quick`: Rapid critical port scanning (default)
- `-t full`: Comprehensive network exploration

#### Timing Templates
- `-T0`: Paranoid (minimal network impact)
- `-T1`: Cautious (low-and-slow approach)
- `-T2`: Conservative (reduced network load)
- `-T3`: Balanced (default scanning strategy)
- `-T4`: Aggressive (faster scanning)
- `-T5`: Intense (maximum speed, higher detection risk)

## Security Considerations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Ethical Use**: Obtain explicit authorization before scanning
- **Legal Compliance**: Unauthorized network scanning may violate laws
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
